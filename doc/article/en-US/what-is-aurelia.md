## [What is Aurelia?](aurelia-doc://section/1/version/1.0.0)

Aurelia is a collection of Modern JavaScript modules, which when used together, function as a powerful platform for building browser, desktop and mobile applications, all open source and built on open web standards.

Let's unpack this statement a little...

### A Collection of Modern JavaScript Modules

Rather than being a monolithic framework, Aurelia is broken down into a collection of feature-oriented modules. Examples of feature modules include metadata, dependency injection, binding, templating, router and more. Each module is written using ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) or TypeScript (a strict superset of JavaScript that adds compile-time type checking). Many of these modules can be used individually in any type of JavaScript project, including Node.js.

### A Powerful Platform for Building Apps

While Aurelia's modules can be used for many purposes, their true power lies in using them together as a front-end application platform. If your end goal is to create rich, engaging experiences for your customers, meeting or exceeding what is found in modern native applications, Aurelia provides the means. Through its rich component model, dynamic UI composition, routing and extensive set of plugins, Aurelia provides a comprehensive set of capabilities and tools to build any front-end experience you can dream up, whether you're targeting the browser, mobile or desktop.

### Open Source

With all the power and capability that Aurelia offers, you might expect it to have an expensive licensing model or be closed source, but neither is true. Aurelia is free and its code is open sourced under [the MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), a very permissive license used by many popular web projects today. Its starter kits and documentation are available under [the Creative Commons 0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) license. It also has [a Contributor's License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/durandalproject/about/blob/master/CLA.md) for those who wish to join the core team in working on Aurelia. Ultimately, this means that you can use Aurelia without fear of legal repercussions and we can build it in the same confidence.

### Built on Open Web Standards

Not only is Aurelia written with ECMAScript, but it's also designed to make careful use of the DOM standard. Rather than Aurelia utilizing a costly abstraction over the DOM, implementing its own custom HTML parser or adopting framework-specific JavaScript extensions, it leverages the latest DOM APIs to get "bare metal" performance, exceptional memory efficiency and all while staying synced with the continuous improvements of the browser platform itself. Additionally, Aurelia's component model is based on W3C Web Components HTML Templates and ShadowDOM, so you know it will stand the test of time and will enable you to evolve your application along with advances in the standards, without major application re-writes or framework churn.

## [Why choose Aurelia?](aurelia-doc://section/2/version/1.0.0)

Here are a few things that make Aurelia unique:

* **Clean and Unobtrusive** - Aurelia is the only framework that lets you build components with plain JavaScript. The framework stays out of your way so your code remains clean and easy to evolve over time.
* **Convention over Configuration** - Simple conventions help developers follow solid patterns and reduce the amount of code they have to write and maintain. It also means less fiddling with framework APIs and more focus on their app.
* **Simple, But Not Simplistic** - Aurelia is simple to learn, but extremely powerful. Because of the simple, consistent design, developers are able to learn a very small set of patterns and APIs that unlock limitless possibilities.
* **Promotes the "-ilities"** - Testability, maintainability, extensibility, learnability, etc. These are often referred to as the "-ilities". Aurelia's design helps developers naturally write code that exhibits these desirable characteristics.
* **Amazingly Extensible** - Aurelia is highly modular and designed to be customized easily. Almost every aspect of Aurelia is extensible, meaning developers will never hit a roadblock or have to "hack" the framework to succeed.
* **Web Standards Focused** - Focused on next generation JavaScript and Web Components, and avoiding unnecessary abstractions that obscure the underlying web, Aurelia is the cleanest and most standards-compliant framework today.
* **Integrates Well with Others** - Because of the extensible design of Aurelia and a number of core technical considerations we made early on, it's easy to integrate Aurelia with any 3rd party library or framework. For example, you can easily integrate with jQuery, React, Polymer, Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS and much more.
* **TypeScript Support** - Each Aurelia library is released with its own d.ts files. We also have official TypeScript beginner kits and production quality starter kits.
* **An Official Product with Commercial Support** - Libraries like Angular, Polymer and React are neither official products of their associated companies nor is any official support or commitment to the library by the company guaranteed. However, Aurelia is an official product of Blue Spire Inc., has enterprise support available and we are committed to it over the long haul. If you are building core technology for your business, you want to know that your technology provider is as committed as you are. Aurelia is a clear choice.
* **Thriving Community and Ecosystem** - With one of the largest and most active developer gitter channels in the JavaScript world, a huge number of contributors and a large active core team, Aurelia has an amazing community. Our ecosystem also includes video training resources, books in production, master class opportunities, upcoming conferences, component libraries, tooling, an official partner network and more. Aurelia has been used to build just about every type of application and is used by large, well-known multi-national companies and enterprises.
